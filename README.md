# avro.tmLanguage
Simple grammar for Avro IDL

Using the grammar from https://github.com/Jason3S/avro.tmLanguage - commit id 73b00556e0b95e4172b42e6782745c81e1d58206

The purpose of this repo is to integrate Avro IDL grammar with https://github.com/github/linguist. Linguist expects its submodules to follow a specific folder structure. Original repo doesn't fit the structure, that's why this repo exists.
